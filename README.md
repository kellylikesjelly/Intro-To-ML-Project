# Intro-To-ML-Project

UPDATE:
I added on a BERT model with ~87% accuracy, which can be viewed separately here: https://www.kaggle.com/tantingxuankelly/medicine-review-bert. It can also be viewed in the notebook medicine-review-bert.ipynb in this repo. BERT is specialised on NLP tasks, hence why it outperforms the other more general models.

We built a machine learning model to identify the illness a patient is suffering from through their text review. We did text data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis, and fit Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost classifiers to the data to see which produced the best results. We also used imblearn Pipeline to correct for extremely skewed class distribution. XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers were identified to be the best performing models.

However it is best to download and view so the long output from some cells can be collapsed for easier viewing since that function is not available on the online version.
